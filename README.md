# INTRODUCTION

Informatica recommends that Ultra Messaging users enable the
automatic monitoring feature in their UM-based applications and most
UM daemons (Store, DRO, etc.).

This repository has a Java module that can be plugged into the
UM MCS program to print the incoming monitoring data in JSON format.
